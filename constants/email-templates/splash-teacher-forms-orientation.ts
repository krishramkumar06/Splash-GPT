  body: `Hello, {{user.first_name}}!

Thank you so much for signing up to teach for {{config.program}} {{config.semesterShort}}! If you are receiving this email, your class has been approved for {{config.program}} on {{config.eventDates}}.

Please note that we can no longer cancel your class as student registration has opened, and you will be responsible for finding a suitable substitute teacher if schedule conflicts arise.

Please read everything below carefully. To teach for {{config.program}}, you will need to complete the following tasks:

All teachers must take both training programs: Health & Safety Training and Training for Child Abuse Reporting.
All teachers must review and sign the Code of Conduct for youth programs.
Please fill out this form with confirmation of completion of the above (screenshots, pdf, etc.) by {{config.trainingDeadline}}, to teach for {{config.program}}.
If you have completed these trainings in the past, you can send proof of those in the form.
Attend one of the teacher training sessions over Zoom during one of the following times. It is mandatory that you attend one of these. Please email us ASAP if you are unable to attend either session.
{{config.zoomSessionsList}}

Returning teachers must attend our training session as it will be different from {{config.program}} training.

Other reminders:
Please add your budget here if it has not already been added. We will only reimburse APPROVED purchases under $30 for each section with a submitted receipt.
All items purchased with {{config.program}} budget (not including items handed out to students) must be returned to {{config.program}} after your class.
If your budget was not approved, please email us your updated budget ASAP. You cannot receive a purchase reimbursement if your budget is not approved before your class.
NEW: Please fill out this form with ALL course materials (slides, printouts, activity instructions, learning plan, etc) and any materials to print by {{config.materialsDeadline}}. We will not reimburse any printing fees as we have our own printers.

Thank you so much for teaching - we look forward to seeing you on {{config.program}} day!

Best,
{{config.directorsTeam}}`,
