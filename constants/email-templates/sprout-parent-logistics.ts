        "<p><strong>Policy on students' interest in classes</strong></p>" +
        "<p>{{config.program}} depends on student enthusiasm. We really cannot emphasize this policy enough. We are very serious about making the day fun, and therefore, we would like to request that you do not push your kids into taking any classes they don't want to.</p>" +
        "<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>" +
        "<p>If you have questions throughout the day, look for the admin team in navy blue shirts in our headquarters (Linsly-Chittenden Hall, room {{config.adminHQ}}) or email us at {{config.email}}. Our contact number on Saturday will be {{config.phone}}</p>" +
