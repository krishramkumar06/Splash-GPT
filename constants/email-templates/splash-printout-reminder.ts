We're so excited to see you this Saturday, {{config.eventDates}}, for {{config.program}}! As a reminder, we ask that you fill out this form with your course materials by {{config.materialsDeadline}}; we can print out 5 pages of black-and-white materials for each student in each section.

Thank you so much for teaching — keep an eye out for further information, and we look forward to seeing you on {{config.program}} day!

Best,
{{config.directorsTeam}}`,
