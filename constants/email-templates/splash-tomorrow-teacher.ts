  body: `Dear {{user.first_name}},

We're so excited to see you TOMORROW! ({{config.eventDatesFull}}), for {{config.program}}! We have a few reminders to help you prepare to teach. The main reminder is that we are in {{config.buildingsShort}}!!!
Rooms
You can see which room your class has been assigned to on our website through the teacher registration link on our website.
We encourage you to check your room as soon as possible prior to your class to ensure that you're able to use any technology you need.

Check-in
Please report to {{config.adminHQ}} (our administrative headquarters) at least 20 minutes before your class is scheduled to start!
To ensure that we can contact you, please make sure that your phone number listed on the website is accurate (and leave your ringer on). You must show up on time to teach.
When you check in, you will receive your class schedule, a t-shirt, and any materials you have requested that weren't approved in your budget.
At this point, you CANNOT cancel your class and are responsible for finding a substitute if you are unable to teach.

Printing Materials
As a reminder, we do offer free B&W printing for up to five pages per student per class.
We do not reimburse any printing fees because we can print it for you.
If you wish to have your materials printed, please complete this form.

Attendance
You must take attendance for students in your class through our website. Use the teacher registration linkhere, and click on the link that says "attendance" near the bottom of each class section in the Manage Your Classes box. Check off each student who shows up, and click submit when you are finished.


Please do not leave students unattended for any reason while you are teaching and do not release your students early, as a matter of safety. If you need tech support, materials, or are having any other issues, just step aside a moment and give us a call. We have phone numbers listed on your teacher schedule, which you will receive once you check in. Additionally, please be aware of the time and do not let your students out early or end your class late. We don't want to have students wandering the halls without a chaperone or for the next teacher to have to rush to get set up. You can call us at {{config.phone}} during the program.

Please let us know if you have any questions! We look forward to seeing you tomorrow!

Best,
{{config.program}} {{config.semesterShort}} Directors`,
