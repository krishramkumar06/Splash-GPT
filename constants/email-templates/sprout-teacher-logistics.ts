  body: `Dear {{user.first_name}},

We're so excited to see you THIS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, {{config.eventDatesFull}}, for {{config.program}}! We have a few reminders to help you prepare to teach.

Communication:
Communication on the day of {{config.program}} for all teachers will be done via this GroupMe {{config.groupMeLink}}

Teacher Forms
Please send proof of completion of your Health & Safety Training form and Training for Child Abuse Reporting.
All teachers must review and sign the Code of Conduct for youth programs.
You must provide confirmation of completion (screenshots, pdf, etc.) ASAP to teach for {{config.program}}. You can do so here. If you have completed these trainings in the past, you can resend proof of those.
These forms are mandatory! If we do not have your forms, you should receive individual communication from us. If we do not get these forms ASAP, we may have to cancel your class.


Materials
You are responsible for purchasing your own class materials. You will be reimbursed for all  approved purchases.
You must send anything you want to be printed for your class to us by midnight on {{config.printDeadline}}. Printing done on your own will not be reimbursed.

Rooms
You can see which room your class has been assigned to on our website through the teacher registration link on our website.
We encourage you to check your room as soon as possible prior to your class to ensure that you're able to use any technology you need.

Check-in
Please report to {{config.adminHQ}} (our administrative headquarters) at least 20 minutes before your class is scheduled to start!
To ensure that we can contact you, please make sure that your phone number listed on the website is accurate (and leave your ringer on). You must show up on time to teach.
When you check in, you will receive your class schedule, a t-shirt, and any materials you have requested that weren't approved in your budget.
At this point, you CANNOT cancel your class and are responsible for finding a substitute if you are unable to teach.

Attendance
You must take attendance for students in your class through our website, yale.learningu.org. Use the teacher registration link here, and click on the link that says "attendance" near the bottom of each class section in the Manage Your Classes box. Check off each student who shows up, and click submit when you are finished.


Please do not leave students unattended for any reason while you are teaching and do not release your students early, as a matter of safety. If you need tech support, materials, or are having any other issues, just step aside a moment and give us a call. We have phone numbers listed on your teacher schedule, which you will receive once you check in. Additionally, please be aware of the time and do not let your students out early or end your class late. We don't want to have students wandering the halls without a chaperone or for the next teacher to have to rush to get set up. You can call us at {{config.phone}} during the program.

Please let us know if you have any questions! We look forward to seeing you this Saturday!

Best,
{{config.directors}}`,
