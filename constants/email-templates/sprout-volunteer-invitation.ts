  body: `Hello hello,

We are reaching out to previous Splash or {{config.program}} teachers to see if you would be interested in volunteering at this semester's {{config.program}} at Yale. It will be held on {{config.eventDatesFull}}. We are looking for volunteers to work with existing admins to help with the running of the event, with the registration process, and ushering of students and parents etc.

You would not need to stay for the entire event, and we greatly appreciate any amount of time you are willing to spend helping out. Please indicate your availability at this form: {{config.volunteerFormLink}}

We'd love to have you back to share your knowledge and enthusiasm with a new group of students! Please come by for free pizza, snacks, and (new) T-shirts!

Best wishes,
{{config.semester}} {{config.program}} Team`,
