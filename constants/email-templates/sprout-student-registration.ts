  body: `Hello!

{{config.program}} at Yale is a twice-year opportunity for {{config.gradeRange}} students to attend classes taught by Yale students in Yale classrooms! We are excited to inform you that student registration for {{config.program}} at Yale is now open, and will close at 11:59PM on {{config.registrationDeadlineFull}}. Registration is on a first come first serve basis and classes fill quickly, so please register as soon as possible. We hope to welcome you back to this fantastic event.

{{config.program}} offers a dynamic two-day program featuring classes taught by Yale students covering various subjects. From A Middle Schooler's Guide to Calculus, to Ancient Cookbooks and Recipes, and Global Health 101, our classes will cater to students from {{config.gradeRange}} this semester. You can find more information, including our registration portal, on our website.

Unlike Splash at Yale, {{config.program}} offers core classes, subjects that are taught over both days, where content from the first carries on to the next—allowing students to delve deeper into their interests! On top of this, {{config.program}} will still involve the fun elective-style classes that you know and love from Splash.

This spring, {{config.program}} will take place on {{config.eventDatesFull}}, from {{config.programTime}}, in {{config.buildings}} on Yale's campus. We cordially invite you to join us for an enriching experience! {{config.program}} costs {{config.cost}} for the two days, with an option to purchase a {{config.tshirtCost}} T-shirt. Financial aid is available to all students who require it.

Once again, you students can register at {{config.studentRegLink}}. We eagerly anticipate welcoming you back to Yale's campus this fall!


Best wishes,
{{config.program}} {{config.semester}} Directors`,
