        "<p><strong>Policy on students' interest in classes</strong></p>" +
        "<p>{{config.program}} depends on student enthusiasm. We really cannot emphasize this policy enough. We are very serious about making the day fun, and therefore, we would like to request that you do not push your kids into taking any classes they don't want to.</p>" +
        "<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>" +
        "<p>If you have questions throughout the day, look for the admin team in navy blue shirts in our headquarters (Linsly-Chittenden Hall, room {{config.adminHQ}}) or email us at {{config.email}}. Our contact number on Saturday will be {{config.phone}}</p>" +

        "<li>Payment is now closed, but you may pay in-person during check in through cash or card for no additional cost.</li>" +
        "<li>You must be enrolled in a class during every time slot. Please email us or check in with us on the morning of the program to ensure you have a full schedule.</li>" +
        "<li>Since we will be moving between two buildings, our administrative staff will be walking students between each building before and after each class. Please wait for a team member and do not walk by yourself between buildings!</li>" +
