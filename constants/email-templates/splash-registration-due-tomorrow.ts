  body: `Hello {{user.first_name}},

We just wanted to remind you that {{config.program}} at Yale {{config.semester}} student registration is closing soon!

{{config.program}} is a one-day program full of classes taught by Yale students on a diverse range of subjects. From "Basics of Special Relativity" to "History of the Aztecs" and " An Introduction to Modular Origami," our classes cater to students from {{config.gradeRange}}. This fall, {{config.program}} will be happening on {{config.eventDates}}, and the Class Catalog is available!

{{config.program}} is a great opportunity to take a class on a subject you're already interested in, or to try out a subject you've never heard of before!  The cost of the program is {{config.cost}}, including lunch. Shirts can be purchased for an additional {{config.tshirtCost}}, and Financial aid is always available to students who demonstrate need.

This is the final reminder that student registration closes TOMORROW, {{config.registrationDeadlineFull}} AT 11:59PM–we are near capacity so sign up ASAP! Payment and financial aid applications are also due at that same time.

Feel free to contact us at {{config.email}} if you have any questions or concerns. We are very excited to see you all this Saturday!

Best,
{{config.directors}}`,
