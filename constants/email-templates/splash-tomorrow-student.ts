  body: `Dear students, parents, and educators,

The {{config.program}} at Yale {{config.semester}} program is TOMORROW ({{config.eventDates}})! We wanted to send along some important reminders to ensure that the day proceeds as smoothly as possible.

Drop-off Location
Please drop-off at {{config.dropoff}}. Volunteers will be present to guide students and parents from there.

Location
The program will be held in {{config.buildings}}. The {{config.program}} Administration Team will have a headquarters in {{config.adminHQ}}.

Check-in
Check-in will be held on the first floor of Linsly-Chittenden Hall, beginning at {{config.checkInTime}}. Please enter through Phelps Gate and walk to Linsly-Chittenden Hall, which will be marked with signs. For check-ins after 10:00 AM, please go to our headquarters location to sign in and receive student schedules. Late payment, t-shirt purchases, and class adjustments will also be available during check-in.

Schedules
Students will be handed their schedules during check-in on the day of {{config.program}}. The schedule will have all the information needed for the day including classes, timeslots, and locations.

Class changes
The Student Portal for class changes is now closed. If a student wishes to change classes, please come to Admin HQ at {{config.adminHQ}}, and we will arrange a schedule change.

Pickup
We recommend students meet parents outside of Phelps Gate to be picked up, however, we allow students to make separate arrangements with their parents if it's more convenient.

Policy on students' interest in classes
{{config.program}} depends on student enthusiasm. We really cannot emphasize this policy enough. We are very serious about making the day fun, and therefore, we would like to request that you do not push your kids into taking any classes they don't want to.

Troubleshooting
If you have questions throughout the day, look for the admin team in navy blue shirts in our headquarters (Linsly-Chittenden Hall, room {{config.adminHQ}}) or email us at {{config.email}}. Our contact number on Saturday will be {{config.phone}}

General Reminders
Payment is now closed, but you may pay in-person during check in through cash or card for no additional cost.
You must be enrolled in a class during every time slot. Please email us or check in with us on the morning of the program to ensure you have a full schedule.
Since we will be moving between two buildings, our administrative staff will be walking students between each building before and after each class. Please wait for a team member and do not walk by yourself between buildings!
Please email us with any dietary restrictions before the day of {{config.program}} so we can plan for lunch accommodations.

Questions? Concerns? Thoughts?
Please look at our webpage (especially FAQ) for more details about {{config.program}}, and feel free to email us at {{config.email}} with anything that isn't addressed there. On the day of the program, you can reach us at {{config.phone}} for urgent questions.

Thanks, and we'll see you soon!
