Welcome to our documentation of the Learning Unlimited (Splash) website, your guide to using your \*.learningu.org website! (For those of you new to this game, here, \* represents some text that likely includes your school’s name.) This guide is organized in an order that is meant to maximize easy use for a beginning admin who is familiar with Splash but not the website while still being a helpful reference for admins who already know their way around the site. Towards that end, we tried to organize the guide as a list of all pages of the site in approximate order of usefulness to the beginner while keeping in mind which sections depend on previous ones and the difficulty of each. On the other hand, we acknowledge the importance of certain features and functionalities that reside in multiple pages (such as setting up an automatic confirmation email to students), so there are numerous annotations and hyperlinks that are designed to make it easier on the readers’ intuitions when some features that are similar or somehow logically connected aren’t always in the same part of this guide. Anything else we want to add? Probably.

Splash <33,

Miles and Daniel

January 2016

July 2016

There are lots of things herein that we’ve described as “self-explanatory.” If you are an admin set loose on this, we encourage you to read the guide as you look at the described item on your website, but we definitely encourage (specific) questions if you find the names or descriptions to be less than self-explanatory. In short, if you’re reading this, please don’t be shy about dropping comments right on this doc to ask questions! We welcome the feedback and will try to respond quickly.

September 2016

We’re 30+ pages deep into this, and there’s no end in sight. We’ve decided to release a chunk to at least the Chapter Board and Mentoring admins before it’s done. We welcome feedback (positive or negative, as long as it’s constructive — and we would strongly prefer feedback that relates to the content, unless the local format or phrasing is particularly difficult to understand) in the form of comments on this document or emails (send to [miles@learningu.org](mailto:miles@learningu.org) please). If you’d like more details on any section or a picture to accompany a paragraph, just say so! If this document withstands that first test, we will share it more widely as time goes on and more pieces fall into place and eventually upload it to GitHub alongside the website code.

I wanted to expand on the above description of the order of this document. We’ve tried a spatial organization of this document, attempting to reflect the order pages of the website one might to encounter as a new admin, so dive right in on the next page if you’re new to the site. If you know what you are looking for, then use Ctrl+f (on a PC) or Cmd+f on a Mac to search for it. We also encourage you make use of the outline headers in the left-hand panel (if you don’t see them, select the fourth option in the “Tools” menu above). We hope you enjoy.

February 2017

As of February 2nd, we are aiming to cut off a chunk of about 8-15 well edited pages! We’ll see how it goes. If you post a comment, please let us know who you are. We’ve used red font to mean that there should be a link here in the final version, but the section we mean to link to does not yet exist. We’re sorry for those. We thought it would be best to get some if it to you sooner. On the night of February 5th, we reached a decent stopping point at page 10. I gave it one more readover for continuity then shared this material with anyone with the link. Once more, we hope you find it useful. ☺

Beginner level
==============

Things you need to know basically from the get-go to function as an admin

How URLs and tabs work on these sites (read this!)
--------------------------------------------------

*   All of the URLs for your website begin the same way: https://\[yourorganizationname\].learningu.org/, where the part in brackets is (as you probably guessed) replaced by the name of your individual organization’s site. Since it can be visual clutter, we will not repeat that beginning of any future URLs (but we will continue to write them in a different font to distinguish them). Instead, we will simply shorten it to the single forward slash (the / character). For instance, if you are a member of Splash at Yale and we wanted to send you to the page to create a custom form (sometimes written customform… deal with it), we would write /customforms, but you would actually want to navigate to https://yale.learningu.org/customforms/.
*   Not bad, right? Consider that your first nugget of insider knowledge for how this behemoth of a site works. Before we share the next abbreviation, we’d like give you a little background on how the site is organized. You can think of it like a tree: from the main page (the tree’s trunk), there are currently about eight branches: teach, learn, volunteer, manage, myesp, admin, theme, and customforms. The first three of those branches have sub-branches, each of which have sub-branches, and so on. This branching pattern is reflected in the URLs that get longer as you go deeper into the sub-branches and end with “leaves” of the tree, which refer to pages with no further sub-pages reflected in the URL. Extending the abbreviation we mentioned above, if we write /teach/somepage/ then we actually mean for you to navigate to \[yoursitename\].learningu.org/teach/somepage/. This will apply to any number of sub-branches after the slash as well.
*   This section gives a very cursory overview of the latter five branches and can be skipped without much loss of continuity. The /themes/, /customforms/, and /myesp branches of the website have no sub-branches, just some leaves (which we put off explaining until later because they are more technical, but the links for where we start discussing them are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.4qs41vxqfrjr) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.uvcxa7w0kn2t), and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.qcgkmjqnovk1), respectively). If you’re curious about what they do, /themes/ allows you to change the stylistic appearance of the site, /customforms/ allows you to create surveys (whose responses you can view either /manage/../../surveys/review or /customforms/ and click “View Responses” for the survey in question; read on to see what the double dots mean) and other forms that you might want to use to collect data, and /myesp branch mostly handles account overhead (such as recovering forgotten passwords and updating profile information). The /admin/ (spread out over several sections of this document, the first being [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.sr2tjz7k40sd)) and /manage branches are portals that together give you control over nearly all the inner workings of the website. Again, these five branches are relegated to later in this document due to their less regular structure and greater complexity, but we wanted to give you an introduction to why they’re there.
*   The structure of the other three branches almost parallel one another. Each branch ties into one or more upcoming events, which is specified using two pieces of information: the type of program (such as Splash, Sprout, Spark, STING, or Cascade) and the instance of the program (when it happens).

*   Thus within the branch of the website aimed at teachers, you may want to direct a teacher to a page that is related to the Splash happening in the Summer of 2010. In that case, the standard URL is /teach/Splash/2010\_Summer/. (We say “standard” because it is possible to choose a different format for your program instances. The section where we discuss how to do so is in the one on the /admin/program/program section of the website; see here.) Thus the pages for volunteers for the 2012 Fall Sprout would probably (unless you have a nonstandard format for a particular program’s branching structure) follow the sequence of branches /volunteer/Sprout/2012\_Fall/. As one final (more specific) example, the page where students can register for the Spring 2011 Cascade would be  /learn/Splash/2011\_Spring/studentreg, unless of course that program had a different branching structure.
*   Don’t worry if you can’t guess links like those yet. Just know they all live under the same branch headers that are formatted this way. We will often collapse thee URLs for generality and brevity, so the last one might be /learn/\[program\]/\[instance\]/studentreg. Other styles (which we’ll probably use more often) include simply /learn/../../studentreg or /learn/../studentreg. In certain unambiguous contexts, we may write simply .../studentreg. Over time, you’ll learn to recognize these contexts and which branch the page in question belongs to (for example, the only branch that has a page called studentreg is the /learn/ branch — if you want to see for yourself, you can go to /teach/../../studentreg and notice the page will not exist for any instance of any program). Though they can be tough to get used to at first, we hope you will eventually appreciate the brevity of such abbreviations. (See here for a trick to reduce the amount of typing you have to do.)

*   Now that you know a little about how the website is organized, you will recognize the tree-like structure as you click through the site (and in the URLs): once you access the program’s main welcome page (getting past the “bubbles” landing page, if your program has one — see [clarkuesp.learningu.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://clarkuesp.learningu.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115874109&usg=AOvVaw1h9dzchMEv4mozayPnFU0h) for an example), the first branches are across the top: teach, learn, and volunteer. (Now you see one reason we excluded the other five from this initial treatment.) Note that these may appear as circles, tabs, or something else, depending on what theme you use (see [yale.learningu.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://yale.learningu.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115874445&usg=AOvVaw1aWgt1aOqG-YddSTfufyQJ), [granite.learningu.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://granite.learningu.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115874527&usg=AOvVaw0cW7WHtYPkxQm9Qzb62-d4), and [splashchicago.learningu.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://splashchicago.learningu.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115874628&usg=AOvVaw0PvgoUuLKgnmE2G-RlyYQE) for examples of all three). After clicking on one branch, there are several tabs that appear along the side (or elsewhere on the page, for the latter two layouts). These tabs lead to leaves, which need to be updated every program to direct to the correct instance (more on that here). We encourage you to play around by clicking on the various tabs on the top and side and paying attention to how the URLs change. Note which pages are static and dynamic (read on [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.tl510sp6n093) if you want a crash course in this concept).
*   Once you’re comfortable with the layout, congrats! You’ve finished the first section of this guide. Pause, take a deep breath, drink some orange juice, ask your senior admins (or mentors/ Chapter Services contact) if you have questions (or drop a comment on this doc), and read on. ☺

Website-ophobia
---------------

(Why should you read this at all?)

Useful tidbit about pages: static versus dynamic
------------------------------------------------

There are two different kinds of pages that comprise the website: static and dynamic. Static pages look the same to everyone (static with respect to the person accessing it). These pages usually end in .html such as /teach/index.html and are commonly used to display public information such as FAQs and program dates. On the other hand, dynamic pages change depending on the user and for this reason require some form of login in order to view them. You can often recognize these pages by the lack of trailing .html (or similar ending). These pages are used for showing the visitor and asking for content that depends on who’s logged in (for instance, if teachers edit their classes, the link to the “edit class” page should show them all and only their own classes, but not anyone else’s classes).

Edit Quasi-static Data  (on pages you can reach while logged in as an admin)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The abbreviation QSD stands for quasi-static data (also called quasi-static content or QSC) and is a term the Web Team is trying to replace with the less technical “editable content.” It refers to the content (text, images, links, and so on) that fills the pages of the website but doesn’t “do” anything (unlike a registration button, for example, which saves some information). You can recognize most of this content by the light gray line of text letting you know you can “click here to edit the text” in the box below. Of course, most visitors can’t edit the text on your front page: only administrators of the site such as you can do so; you can think of this as one sense in which the content on the page is quasi\-static.
*   Okay, so now that you know where to find this stuff, how do you actually edit it? Following the light-gray text’s prompts, click just above the content (on the light gray text itself) to open an editable text box. Be careful -- this is live now! Any changes you make will be reflected in the site. \*\*Clicking anywhere outside the box will take you out of your editing, so make sure you have your writing down before clicking out.\*\* How to make changes? Read on….
*   One of the first things you’ll notice is that the editable text doesn’t look nearly as nice and neat in editing mode as it does displayed on the site. The plain text that you can edit is formatted using the language(s) HTML and/or Markdown. You can read more about these by searching for them ([w3schools.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3schools.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115878236&usg=AOvVaw2fpCWb_ikZ4VnLiHrBNQ7M) is a good resource). You can probably figure out a bit on your own, but make sure that any changes you make in the right language. If you like, find an inconspicuous spot of the website and try making a (G-rated, please ☺) change right now.
*   Wait… I don’t see my changes. What gives?! Well, you may have just encountered the magic of [caching](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115878717&usg=AOvVaw0iUG67WXIev8OhGQLGgsxx) (click [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://shouldiblamecaching.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115878790&usg=AOvVaw2HZeV9sZEj3Y7ypfzRhHLv) to know if it’s causing your problem). Roughly, the site remembers that your computer was recently on this page and so rather than go to the trouble of reloading the whole page from the server (where your changes are likely stored, safe and sound), the site grabs [the version it just load for you a moment ago](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D1Ciz5rFpBIk&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115879143&usg=AOvVaw2whYIUoQk40jaqIZGnMWd3) (before you made your changes). Very loosely put, you have to remind it that you are not the average user and tell it to refresh before you check and get outta there. In order to do so, you can clear the cache with a hard refresh.  
            Most browsers have a way of doing this (search “how do I clear my cache in \[browser name\]?” if you like), but there is one simple but essential trick you should know in order to clear the cache and reload the up-to-date page with your changes. The trick is called SHIFT + REFRESH. Hold down the Shift key, and refresh the page (by any means you like). Now you should see your changes. If anything ever seems like it’s not happening when it should, always remember... use shift+refresh. Never forget that.
*   That’s it for the basics of editing QSD, congrats! One last note before we move on to the next section: so far everything we’ve shown you all applies to pages you can reach while you’re logged in as a website administrator (“admin”). Some of you may then wonder how to edit text on pages you can’t reach while logged in (such as the “forgot my password” page). It is possible, but we thought it is beyond the scope of “beginner” tasks, so we made [a separate section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.x71jzhdaqdac) to find how how to edit QSD on pages you can’t reach directly while logged in.

The black Manage tab
--------------------

This tab gives you access to the main program management page for a given program; this is a quick overview of what you see there.

*   Now as an admin for your program, you have access to a tab called “Manage” which allows you to access most administrative capabilities on the website. You should see this tab on the left of your screen. This page is where you begin almost all functions for a specific program!
*   When you click this tab, you will arrive at the /manage/programs/ page.

*   At the top of the page, there is an editable text box where many programs store hyperlinks to a couple of pages to under the /manage/ branch that are not easily accessed through that tab, so you may find it useful to add these links (or any others of your choosing) into the editable text on this page.

*   Page to view all and manage QSD pages: /manage/pages/. This page shows you all [static pages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.tl510sp6n093) on your website. The URLs often spill over, as you will see. For a given row, the “Move” link allows you to change the URL that directs to the page in that row, and the “Delete” button removes that page from existence.
*   Flush cache: /manage/flushcache/ \[please do this carefully!!\]

*   After this editable text, you should see a list of all programs your organization has run (or is running). Click the relevant program for anything you need to do for that program.
*   At the bottom is a link to begin the process for [creating a new program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.ezf8sdfkuw65).

Deadlines
---------

### Opening and closing important deadlines

### How to access the deadlines page

### Most deadlines are pretty self-explanatory; we should briefly cover some that aren’t

### How the interface works: opening, closing, and setting automatic open/close times (and the quirks -- unless they’ve been worked out for SR8?)

### Anything else?

### \*Intermediate: Overriding certain deadlines (i.e. what are sub-deadlines, how to make them,)

### \*Advanced: understanding how permissions interact with deadlines

Dashboard
---------

The dashboard is one of the central hubs for program management. You can use this center for finding out program statistics, like how many students are signed up for classes, as well as manage class submissions. This section will be broken down into these two parts.

### Program Statistics

*   Nearly all important program statistics are located under the program vitals section of the dashboard. This information is primarily reports, so we have many links to the other explanations we give on how to modify what information is reported and associated modules. You will see horizontal bars with labels like “students,” “teachers,” and “classes.”  Here’s what the program vitals section will look like for an example Splash Fall 2016:  
    ![](./LU Website Documentation_files/unnamed.png)  
    Click on any of these tan bars to expand the selection and view statistics relevant to that label. (If the program is big, it may take a while for the bar to load.)
*   “Students” provides you data on the students that have begun signing up for the given program. Most of the numbers’ descriptions are self-explanatory (but comment here if you want more explanation). Here are explanations of some we find less clear.

*   All Student Representatives of ESP – the number of specially designated students whom admins choose to advertise your organization (here’s how to do that)
*   Students who are enrolled in at least one class – the number of students who are enrolled by lottery into at least one class (if you don’t use a lottery system, this number is the same as “students signed up”)
*   Students who filled out the survey – “the” survey refers to a student survey (created via the student survey module, not a student questionnaire using a [custom form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.uvcxa7w0kn2t) and a [tag](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.be2xh7hvp1zf))
*   Students who are accepted to at least one class. – the number of students whose application an admin has reviewed accepted (only relevant for programs that use student applications)

*   “Teachers” provides information on teachers’ progress in registration or status relevant to their classes. Many of the teacher statistics on teachers are similar to ones below in the “Classes” section, but readers are encouraged to comment here to request more explanation.
*   “Classes” gives the following statistics on teachers’ classes:

*   Total # of Classes – the number of classes that prospective teachers have collectively proposed for this program
*   Total # of Class Sections – the total number of sections (counts copies if a teacher wants to teach the same class more than once)
*   Total # of Lunch Classes – if you use “Lunch Class” option (if not, feel free to ignore this point; it will just say zero), the number of classes that you have marked as Lunch Classes
*   Total # of Classes Unreviewed – the number of classes submitted by teachers but not yet given seen (or [explicitly designated as such](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#id.ccuhzyty9ro1)) by an admin
*   Total # of Classes Accepted – the number of classes submitted by teachers and approved by an admin
*   Total # of Classes Rejected – the number of classes submitted by teachers and rejected by an admin
*   Total # of Classes Cancelled – the number of classes that teachers have cancelled (or that an admin [has cancelled on their behalf](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#id.azw7ri9ji83d)) using the cancel class button

*   “Categories” gives you the total number of (accepted and unreviewed) classes, class sections, and class hours (the scheduled amount of time, given in hours, that all class sections in a given category occupy) broken up into categories (such as arts, humanities, sciences, math). Teachers give each of their classes a category when they register it. You can decide in advance what categories are available for teachers to choose from at the beginning of program creation. (Here’s how to modify these choices after the program is already created.)
*   “Grades” gives the number of students enrolled in at least one class split by grade, as well as the number of classes and class sections available to students in each grade. This table can be useful when you schedule classes to ensure that there is an appropriately balanced number of classes during each time block available to students in each grade.
*   “Hours” gives the following three numbers, where the unit is hours. Since many Splashes use 50-minute time slots, there are often rounded decimals in this section.

*   Total # of Class-Hours – the total amount of time all scheduled sections of all classes occupy
*   Total # of Class-Student-Hours (capacity) – the sum over all classes of the amount of time of each section multiplied by the number of available seats in (the “capacity” of) that section
*   Total # of Class-Student-Hours (registered) – as above, but only counts students registered for that section, not the number of seats available

*   “Timeslots” displays the number of students registered for a class at each time slot during the day. Here is where we give more detail on time slots, including where to create and modify them.

*   Block Name: when – the name range of time the slot occupies; for instance, Class 1: 9 - 9:55 AM
*   Students: registered / capacity, meaning the number of students registered for at least one class during this block shown as a portion of the maximum  number of students that can possibly register for at least one class during this block
*   Classes: the number of classes that have been scheduled during this block

*   “T-shirts” gives the number of shirts of each size and type for teachers.  (These options of how to set which sizes are available and whether to remove “fitted” option can be modified by [tags](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.4jjvlhvqc870).) There are a number of pending changes to the table, including the removal of size names being displayed twice, all zeros displayed when the “fitted option” is removed, and customizing which sizes are available for teachers to choose from.
*   “Lunch and Sibling Discounts” displays the number of students who have signed up (and the number that have not) for each available lunch block, as well as the number of students who receive a sibling discount (and the number of students who do not), provided this module is enabled. Most programs do not use it and will see SplashInfo module is not enabled -- no statistics.
*   “Accounting” gives the total number of completed credit card payments (note: this number may be different from the number of students who have paid, if a student makes multiple partial payments, for instance) made through the website and the total amount paid in those transactions combined.

### Class management

Underneath the statistics are all class submissions. The gray box at the top of this section explains how to email all of the students enrolled in this class, all teachers of this class, or both (the entire class). There are a few explanatory notes on how to sort all of the class submissions.

For every class submission, you will see (from left to right) its code/title/status, links to each section, the teacher’s name (or co-teachers’ names), and four management buttons. We will cover these columns in that order.

*   The code/title/status contains three pieces of information.

*   The code consists of the abbreviated class category followed by the class number.

*   The abbreviated version of the class category (as described in the “Categories” section [above](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#id.9y0uy1kmay7b)) is usually the first letter or two of the category: common abbreviations are to use A for arts, S for science, X for miscellaneous. If you don’t like these abbreviations, you can learn how to modify them here).
*   The class number (this number is simply order in which the class has been registered, so A1 is the first class ever registered, and it happened to be an arts class; there will be never be another class on your website with the number 1).
*   An example is S105, which means this class is a science class and was the 105th class ever (not just for this particular program) registered on your website.

*   The title is the name the teacher(s) gave this class.
*   The status is the current state of review one or more admins have given the class (cancelled, rejected, unreviewed, accepted but hidden, and accepted). There are a few distinctions we thought might be helpful:

*   Cancelled versus rejected: cancelled usually means the teacher decided it would no longer be possible to teach this class (or section) or that the class was previously accepted but no longer accepted after student registration began. Cancelling a class or section from the class management page (read on) prompts the admin to notify the students of the cancellation and unschedule the class. On the other hand rejecting a class is usually done in advance of scheduling and student registration. It doesn’t really make sense to reject just a single section of a class from, but it does to cancel one (if there’s a scheduling conflict, for instance).
*   Accepted but hidden classes will not appear in the catalog.

*   A class is automatically labeled as unreviewed as soon as it is submitted by a teacher or after the teacher makes changes to an accepted class. However, admins can also mark a class as unreviewed from any other status (for instance, to put off the decision to accept/reject it until conferring with other admins or pending a modification by the teacher).

*   The links to each section go to the student selection page for that section. That page gives some basic information (including location and capacity) about that section and is where admins and teachers can accept or reject students’ applications into that class section (if you use applications).
*   The teachers column gives the name of the teacher who submitted the class, or the names of all co-teachers listed on the class (if there is more than one person listed as teaching that class).

#### Four “Management Options” buttons

*   The Delete button removes a class from the list. Do not use this for class cancellations or rejections (see the previous list). There is usually little or no reason to use this button instead of the reject option.
*   The Edit button takes you to the same interface teachers use to create (and later edit) their classes. It allows you to modify the class details as if you were the teacher. Saving any edit sends an email to the teacher(s) and the program directors alerting them of your changes.
*   The Manage button takes you to the class management page where you can to view and change schedule-based aspects of the class. There are a number table interfaces in this section, each preceded by a short explanation.

*   The first table gives you an overview of the class details, but it includes links to rosters (lists of names, grades, and schools) of all students enrolled in individual sections, as well as a combined roster of the students in all sections, to email addresses, and to the student selection page. Teachers also have access to the rosters by clicking the “View Students” button at the bottom of the teacher registration page.
*   The second table is underneath the first is an interface to add [class flags](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.oom2th44lcpz) (notes that admins can attach to a class that are directed towards other admins and invisible to teachers) to classes. If you have not enabled any class flags for this program, you will see a single sentence notifying you as much and a link to where you can enable some.
*   The third table allows you to cancel the class or one of its individual sections.
*   The fourth table allows you to view and modify several parameters of each class, as well as set some individual information for each section of the class. Make sure to hit “Save” at the bottom of each box after making any changes.

*   The status button presents you with a popup box that allows you to easily view many details of a class. (There is a small quirk that presents the duration of all classes one minute shorter than expected, but it is innocuous.) At the bottom of the popup, there are three buttons to change the status of this class (see above for descriptions of each status). This button is often the fastest way to view class information or change the class’ status because it doesn’t load another page.

### Congratulations! You now understand the dashboard! This interface is key to overseeing your programs.

Searching for users in admin toolbar
------------------------------------

*   Unless your site uses a custom theme, you should notice the admin toolbar on every page. An example of this toolbar is below![](./LU Website Documentation_files/unnamed(1).png)
*   The search bar allows you to search for any user of the website, whether it be student, teacher, volunteer, parent, or educator. The search function will take

*   \[Firstname\]
*   \[Firstname Lastname\]
*   \[Lastname\]
*   \[username\]
*   \[userIDnumber\]
*   \[Email address\]
*   \[Class title\]

*   NOTE: If you enter an incomplete name (for example “sam”), the website will search for any user with a name containing those letters (the above example would return users with first names Sam, Samuel, Sammy, Samantha, Samir, and last names Grissam or Sampson but will not return anyone who misspelled their name as “Sma”)
*   The search will then give you all results. You can use this to identify duplicate accounts, since you will find some double entries of names and user info. If there is only one account to show, then the website will automatically show you that account. Sometimes different people with the same name make separate accounts, so it is good practice to check two accounts’ other information before assuming it’s a duplicate.
*   There is a lot of information on the page for when you search for a user. Here are some key things:

*   Name, username, ID, address, phone number, email at the top.
*   Grade, school, emergency contact info, classes taken/taught below
*   Morph into user on the right allows you to see the website as if you were that user. This means that if you have not opened up student registration and try to go to student registration while morphed as a student, you will receive the error message saying registration is not yet open. \[This behavior was actually changed in SR7 -- now [morphed admins can bypass required modules](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/pull/1313&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115901033&usg=AOvVaw1Gp3e9ijJRx4h-MCr7wNsl). Not sure if it still holds true for deadlines, etc.\] Morphing into users is an extremely useful tool, and can be used to

*   Perform actions for somebody (ex: changing a teacher’s availability for them) \[link to how to change this via /admin\]
*   Check how students, teachers, and parents see the website (ex: Student says, “I’m receiving an error message when I try to sign up for student registration!!!” You can morph into them to see if that is actually what they ought to see.
*   What other uses can we think of? We should maybe also say when morphing is better/worse than other techniques? (usually involving /admin/)
*   Note: you can't use the morph interface if a teacher is not already teaching for the program; it will only find users who are teaching for that program.  (On the other hand, If you use user search on the left, and click the morph button on that, it should still work.)

*   Deactivate user on the right -- This will prevent that specific account from receiving any further emails or be considered as an account when creating [arbitrary user lists](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.eeygfp3hgpqf). However, the account’s information will still be in your website database, for reference if ever needed. Use this to “unsubscribe” users. Don’t forget to check for duplicate accounts!

*   Also, deactivated accounts sometimes show up in dashboard counts (this is a known bug, but don’t be surprised if dashboard counts and AULs differ by a couple of users.

Arbitrary User Lists (AULs for short)
-------------------------------------

*   When you want to create a list of users that fit certain criteria, the website’s arbitrary user list function is the way to accomplish this efficiently. Under the manage tab, go to the relevant program you are running and look in the bottom right for a link called arbitrary user lists.
*   The first thing that will pop up is a nice drop down menu beneath two tabs: “Basic List” and “Combination List”. It is important to note that Combination List can do almost everything a basic list can do and more! For this reason, it is almost always best to use the Combination List. I will first explain Combination List, and then elaborate on capacities of Basic List with relation to Combination List.
*   Under Combination List, you must pick a starting criterion. The website will then generate whatever information you desire on the users that fit this criterion. After selecting one, you will move to a further criteria list. As an example, let’s choose “Students who signed up for at least one class”

*   Looking at further criteria, we can see that we can add on any of the other previous criteria to our starting list. Let’s say that we want to get students who have 1) signed up for at least one class, 2) have filled out the financial aid application, but 3) have not yet been granted financial aid.
*   We already accomplished #1 through our starting list.
*   #2 is added by selecting the checkbox to the left of the AND for the option “Students who have completed a financial aid application”
*   #3 is added by selecting both checkboxes left of AND and NOT for “Students who have been granted financial aid”
*   This gives us “Students who have signed up for a class AND students who have completed a financial aid application AND NOT students who have been granted financial aid”
*   Note: When you want to use the NOT checkbox, you must always use AND in conjunction

*   As another example, say you want to generate a list of teachers who have either signed up for teacher training or signed up for an interview.

*   To accomplish this, you would choose “Teachers who have signed up for an interview” under your starting list
*   Then, you would check the OR box for “Teachers who have signed up for teacher training”.
*   Note: Selecting AND would give you teachers who have signed up for BOTH training and interview, not a list of teachers who have signed up for either option.

*   After working through these examples, you should be able to understand how the website works in evaluating criteria for generating lists. There is one further way to evaluate this list you are generating through the Add filters button.

*   Add Filters allows you to take the list and get rid of anybody that does not fit certain demographic information. You can choose between User ID, User name, First and last name, e-mail address, ZIP code, states, school, and grade.
*   For example, let’s say I wanted to know how many students have signed up for a class that are from the state of New York. I would create a starting list of “Students who signed up for at least one class” and then filter it down by typing in “CT” to the states field of the Add filters option.

*   Lastly, click continue. The website will tell you how many users fit your criteria, and you can then choose what information about those users the website wants to spit out at you. Continuing from the above example, let’s say I wanted to know the names and schools of the students from Connecticut that have signed up for a class. I would check the boxes for Full name and School and then press Go.
*   If I wanted to generate the above list but split up the users based on what school they went to, I would click the dropdown menu “Split by” and choose School. Split by lets you sort your information more easily according to whatever criteria you want.
*   Now, what does Basic List do? Basic List is just Combination List but only with the option of choosing one criterion. The “email the students’ guardians” and “email the students’ emergency contacts” only work when using the [email communications panel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.2eafu3k7wi12) (the “comm panel”), but this option is not possible through Combination List.
*   Basic Uses: Extracting information on users from the website, pre-sorting lists of people, gathering email addresses of students/teachers that fit criteria (ex: teachers who have indicated interest by filling out the information but have not registered a class)
*   Arbitrary user list formatting is used in multiple modules
*   \*Intermediate/Advanced: Combining this with Excel or Google Sheets and for nefarious purposes

How to send emails through the website
--------------------------------------

*   The interface for sending emails (usually en masse) is the Communications (“Comm”) Panel, and is accessible at /manage/../../commpanel.

*   One of the most powerful features of the website is its ability to send mass emails. Imagine copying and pasting [Arbitrary User Lists](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.eeygfp3hgpqf) of email addresses into the BCC field of a message in your Splash’s Gmail (by the way, if you want to know how to give your Gmail a \*.learningu.org redirect, [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.o3u6d8e747nu)). Good thing you don’t have to….
*   .How to get to the panel

*   The communications panel can be accessed from the main program management page /manage/../../main or directly at /manage/../../commpanel. The reason the panel is linked to a particular program is that (just as for [AULs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.eeygfp3hgpqf)), you can choose to send messages to lists of people based on their relationship to a given program (for instance, perhaps you want to email all the first time teachers; this list will change from program to program).

*   Here’s a short but lacking version of what follows

*   Choose the group you're trying to contact (students vs. teachers).
*   Click "Continue to select set of contacts" right below.
*   Choose the subset of teachers (“all teachers” is a common one).
*   Click “continue.”
*   Enter your email address in the “From” field on the next page that appears. Enter a subject and body into those fields as you would with other emails, and click “Go to Preview.”
*   This step is important!! Reread everything from the “From” field down to the email body. If anything looks off, go back by clicking “Edit your Email” button. Then repeat step 5.
*   Only once you are satisfied that your email is great, then click “Send Message!”
*   Be patient and leave some time -- it takes a while to send these emails.

*   Basics of using the panel

*   Choosing recipients

*   This interface is essentially the same as for AULs (see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.eeygfp3hgpqf) for tips on using these effectively), but the “email the guardians” actually does send an email to the guardians (as does the “emergency contacts” checkbox) instead of students themselves. Be careful with this feature!
*   It is prudent to have emergency contacts for students listed in the website, however, listing contact information is not the same as subscribing to your newsletter, and it is not appropriate to email the emergency contacts unless there is an emergency. A similar rule applies to the guardians. Do not email guardians to let them know that registration has opened; if they want this information, they can create a guardian account.
*   A final word of caution: choosing recipients matters -- double check that you are selecting the right list of people, and make use of the “filter” feature and the “number of users” displayed on the next page (see below). Seriously, use your brain and double check that that number looks right!
*   Once you get a few emails under your belt, try using the “Previous e-mails” tab to select an old email (by subject line or what...? upon further inspection, I’m not sure if this feature works post-datatree-redo of February 2014) and set your list of recipients to be the same as for that message. You will have a chance to edit the text before you send the email; make sure you still proofread carefully since dates and other information can change! This option allows you to reuse lists of users for more emails.

*   After selecting your recipients, you will come to a page where you can type your email. Check the number of recipients at the top! It matters! If it doesn’t seem at least ballpark right, then click “go back” and figure out why. A quick note: ballpark is okay -- sometimes inactive accounts display differently on the [dashboard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.619zx6hx7zhm), [AUL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.eeygfp3hgpqf) count, and comm panel. Don’t worry if your numbers are off by one or two. (Clever use of AULs will allow you to figure out whose account is causing the off-by-one error, if you want to.)
*   Choosing other parameters

*   From  
    This field is what displays in your recipient’s inbox as the “from” person. As of writing this, you may enter either text or an email address, but be warned -- some spam filters are more likely to catch your message if it is not from an email address. The default is your account’s email address (namely, [yourusername@yoursite.learningu.org](mailto:yourusername@yoursite.learningu.org)); this will redirect to whatever email address your account is created under, but unless you want your students to see and reply to [puppieslovepandasxoxo95@yahoo.com](mailto:puppieslovepandasxoxo95@yahoo.com) or whatever your personal inbox is, then you’re probably better off putting in your Splash’s email.
*   Reply-to  
    Don’t use this feature unless you have a reason for having your recipients reply to a different address than the “From” address. (One reason might be that the “From” isn’t really an email address; perhaps you don’t have a problem with the spam filters.)
*   Subject  
    Nothing special here -- usual subject field for sending an email. Make it short and relevant to your audience. The subject “F16 program date” might be useful to you for cataloging, but something like “U of X Splash next save-the-date” is likely to be a more useful to your readers. There are, of course, many different subject lines useful to both parties.

*   Writing the message body

*   Here’s the actual writing the email part. Do your thing. See [below](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.5hd7g2v09kdo) for tips on writing a good email. As of writing this (see note below that this section may change), you may enter plain text (not recommended unless your message is very short), [HTML, or Markdown](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.do3j8m8nnf97).
*   Dynamic emails: using the {{ variables }} and using them well

*   One of the coolest tricks the comm panel has is the ability to customize your email to the individual recipients. The variables are displayed on the panel to the right of the text box where you write the message body.
*   Tip: you can use these to add a personal touch, but don’t make it sound unnatural (for instance, it is friendly to say “Hi, Susie” but weird to say “Hi, Susie Smith”). In particular, let people know when you’re using their username or other “data.” See [below](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.5hd7g2v09kdo) for more tips.
*   Warning: if you’re copying text from a previous email, make sure that you correctly replace the literals (the actual names and so forth) with the right variables like {{ user.first\_name }}. Failing to do so will lead all your users to think they’re receiving the wrong message (and possibly see someone else’s schedule or personal information).
*   Warning: Copying and pasting from outside sources like Google Docs or Microsoft Word runs the risk of “Smart Quotations”, which are formatted quotation marks “”. These can present issues in emails that have hyperlinks in them.

*   we highly recommend including the following brief facts somewhere in each email you send via the comm panel (some chapters require this)

*   why the recipient is getting this message: namely, registered for an account under the username {{ user.username }}
*   why they might have gotten multiple copies (duplicate accounts, or if you didn’t heed our warnings above and incorrectly emailed guardians and/or emergency contacts)
*   how to unsubscribe from future emails (as of writing this, it may be legally required to include a one-click unsubscribe message; we are not lawyers, so we cannot give official advice, but in the definition of one-click unsubscribe, it is sufficient to include an invitation for the recipient to to reply to the undesired email and request to be unsubscribed); regardless of legalities, it’s good form to include an offer to unsubscribe

*   Previewing the message (don’t forget to verify the number of recipients!)

*   In case we haven’t made it clear enough, sending an email is a big deal. You’ve put a lot of thought into your message, so make sure that you proofread your work carefully! The feeling when you catch an error in your email after it’s hit your inbox (or worse, if an angry/confused parent points it out to you) is not worth the time you’d save by not previewing the email carefully or asking a colleague to.
*   You should have already double-checked that the recipients were chosen carefully and the number of recipients (link to that section) is at least roughly correct.
*   Tip: always have (at least) two pairs of experienced but fresh eyes read each message before sending \[for some chapters this is a hard and fast rule\]. Read for not just correctness of your fact but style and tone: being both friendly and professional is an important thing, and the holistic “feel” of your email can make a big difference to your audience.

*   Click send (then don’t click the back button), be patient, and see below for common troubleshooting errors. You’ve now just let hundreds of people know about your program!

*   ### Tips for using the communications panel (or any time you’re communicating with lots of people at once)
    

*   I’m tempted to add some tips (perhaps here, perhaps elsewhere) on writing a good email, beyond the tidbits I’ve already sprinkled throughout above. See the beginning of my [guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jWTtD9LEQ022zhO29ST87rBxJHnb1ot0JPt22mspd4/edit&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115918631&usg=AOvVaw0j8YDSl5I1CTkVCKQd3Lur) for more (it’s not much, but it’s something).
*    \[Using  already-formatted email outlines or templates that only need proofreading and minor tweaks can be helpful but must be done with great caution! Not just because smartquotes confuse the comm panel, but also because dates, policies, what’s already been mentioned, what needs repeating, and so forth change from program to program and email to email; it is very tempting to proofread less carefully when using an existing template or outline. Resist this temptation!\]

*   Troubleshooting:

*   emails do not always send quickly (link to section on dbmail/textofemails)
*   emails do not always evade spam filters (sorry)
*   emails sometimes don’t get sent or get sent multiple times (a known issue involves people with accented letters in their names who also have multiple accounts; email webteam if you suspect this is happening).

*   Test run student and teacher registrations

*   Yes, doing this matters! Anything that dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of people are going to see is worth reading and checking several times over. (Didn’t you read the email section, dummy?)
*   Make a fake account (do this to avoid admin privileges)
*   Click through the links (all of them! even the ones you wouldn’t use)
*   “Pretend to be dumb” and try to see what things might not be understood. Get a friend who doesn’t do Splash and have them try to register with the fake account while you watch. Any confusion? Fix it.

Financial aid approval (aka intro to /admin/)
---------------------------------------------

*   Intro to Administration Pages

*   By now, we hope you’re feeling more confident moving around the website and running a Splash more generally. (We did just run you through a list of all things to check before opening registration.) At this point, we’re prepared to take you into the final branch of the website: the admin(istration) panel, also known as /admin (pronounced “slash admin”).
*   You can access this branch by simply navigating to typing /admin at the end of your website’s URL or clicking “Administration Pages” on your admin toolbar on the left. This panel is the most powerful but also the most complicated, so tread carefully and pay attention here.
*   The first thing you’ll notice is a long list of links taking you to various sections. Feel free to read through and get a sense of what they are about (to whatever extent you can). They are all documented in this guide, though, so no worries if you feel overwhelmed.
*   Take special note of one of the links in the upper left: the documentation link. While that is incomplete, it can be very useful if what you’re looking for is there covered well.

*   Using the the FinAid approval panel

*   How to get there  
    Under “Accounting” (link is /admin/accounting/), click “Financial Aid Grants” (link /admin/accounting/financialaidgrant/). Not too bad, huh?
*   Finding the requests you want  
    As with nearly all objects in any page under /admin, you can re-order the requests by any of its properties by simply clicking that property at the top (for instance to filter by finalized requests, click “Finalized” once to get unfinalized requests first and twice to get finalized first). You can filter by multiple properties, in whatever order you click them. You’ll probably want to order requests for the most recent program and view unfinalized ones. Unless you’re looking for a particular request, just dive in and choose any one you like.
*   How to approve a request  
    Once you’ve located the request you want, click on the ID number (on the far left of the page) to view it. Enter either a number of dollars and cents (no dollar sign, but do include a decimal point) in “Amount max dec” or a percent (number from zero to one hundred, no decimal point, no percent sign) for the amount you want to grant this student. You should have decided how much to grant above (link). Check off “Finalzed” and hit “Save” at the bottom. That’s it! Move on to the next request.
*   History  
    The “History” button in the upper left allows you to see what changes (if any) have been made to this grant since the request was received.

*   Troubleshooting and things to watch out for

*   This is not the only page where you can grant FinAid: see link for information about FinAid Requests (this section is about grants). /admin/program/financialaidrequest/

*   Similar to above; this is where you can read and decide what to do with this request. Most programs are quite lenient and will fill any sincere request (to us, “sincere” means most anything short of “ha ha bet u won’t read this... i’m trying to game your system l00zr adminszzzz”)
*   Note you do not need to/should not change anything in the first two text boxes
*   You should enter the amounts as above to grant them the aid from this page (you we should check that it displays correctly in the Grants section). \[I’m confused… something has changed. Is it no longer required to look at the grants section? Can everything be done from the requests section (including/except sending them a confirmation email)?\]

*   Sending a confirmation email  
    Sadly, as of writing this, there is no way (that Miles remembers -- perhaps there is a way to use dbmail to set something up) to set up an automatic confirmation email. There is, however, a way to use the [comm panel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.2eafu3k7wi12) to email all students who have been approved for financial aid to let them know that they have.

*   Note: This section may change/move soon as there is a pending request for FinAid approval to be moved to the main program management page.

Student Registrations on /admin/
--------------------------------

*   While you have learned to morph into users, this can be a right pain in the arse to do every time you need to do something for somebody. In addition, morphing into users is sometimes restricted in its capabilities. Now that you have familiarized yourself with /admin for FinAid, we can get to know another very useful link in /admin.
*   Under the category “Program”, you should find the link “Student Registrations”. Click it.
*   You will now have a list of all the different registrations of students for different classes. We will do a rundown of all the different functionalities on this page.
*   First, the most important button, is add student registration in the upper right. This is usually used when you are registering a student for a class for them.

*   Start date is automatically assigned as the current time. This is the time starting from which this registration is effective.
*   End date is the point in time when the student will no longer be considered registered for the class. Generally, this is left blank since you are adding the registration…
*   Section is the class the student wants to be in. You may type in the course’s code or the course name. The plus button isn’t generally needed since that creates a new class section.
*   User is the student you are adding the registration for. You can type in first name, last name, userID, or username. The plus button isn’t generally needed since that creates a new user.
*   Relationship is the user’s relationship to the course. Generally, you will choose “Enrolled”, so long as the user is being allowed in the course.
*   Once you are done, hit save in the lower right.
*   Note: Doing student registrations on /admin will override many different restrictions. It will register the student even if

*   The class is full
*   The class is outside the student’s grade range
*   The student already has a class signed up for that timeslot
*   Student registration is closed

As a result, this is very useful when you do not want to create new deadlines, open old ones, create new permissions, or go about a lot of nonsense when you morph into a user.

*   You can back out into student registrations by clicking the “student registrations” link towards the top of the page.
*   You can filter your view of which registrations you want to see by

*   A. Clicking the Filter dropdown menu on the right. This lets you choose which program’s registrations to see. OR
*   B. Doing a search for a user or course title. This is useful when you want to do something like deregister one student from all their courses.

*   Lastly, let’s say you want to deregister a student from a class for them.

*   Click the checkbox next to whichever course registration you want to deregister.
*   In the bottom left, click the drop-down menu and choose “expire student registrations”. Expiring registrations automatically adds an end time and thus frees up the spaces in the class for other students.
*   You can even check multiple lines and expire them all at once. If you want to undo an deregistration, click the checkbox next to the line affected, click the dropdown menu to the bottom right, and choose “renew student registrations”. This will remove the end time.

*   Now you understand student registrations!

Student Registration Bigboard
-----------------------------

Day-Of Class Changes via the onsite class change grid
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Most any Splash program will need to be able to make on-the-fly changes to students’ classes during the day of the program. Luckily, there is a very easy way to do this!
*   Under the black Manage tab, scroll to the bottom to find the “Onsite” link.
*   Locate “Grid-based class changes interface” (should be at the top). Click it.
*   You should see a colorful spreadsheet organized by timeblock. These are all the classes of the day.
*   Search for the student that you want to help in the search bar. You can use first name, last name, username, or userID.

*   Switching their classes is as easy as choosing which class they want from the list, and clicking the checkbox.
*   You can override certain restrictions (class full, class outside grade range) through the checkboxes in the upper right.

*   Quick discussion of alternatives (morphing, etc.) and why not to use them on the day of
*   Note: Prior to the day of the program, do not use this to do any class switches or registrations for a student. Doing so will check the student in, and if the student doesn’t show up, attendance records will be inaccurate.

Checking in students and teachers via onsite
--------------------------------------------

*   Navigate to on-site as you did for day-of class changes
*   For student check-in, select “Check-in (check students off for payments and forms)”

*   You may then enter a student’s name, username, or ID into the rapid check-in.
*   OR you may use the barcode check-in which takes user IDs.

*   Keep in mind that the website only saves IDs into the database after you have pressed “submit”, so submit regularly as you buildup IDs in the text box so as not to lose all the check-ins should there be a crash.

*   For teacher check-in,  select “Check-in teachers”

*   Teacher check-in is separated based on timeslots. Select the appropriate timeslot to bring up a list of all teachers that are teaching during that slot. Phone numbers of teachers are listed so that you may call them if they are late to show up.
*   IMPORTANT: Teachers who teach multiple times in a day or on multiple days will appear checked in at future timeslots after their first check-in. Keep this in mind when you wish you confirm that all teachers have shown up to teach. You can un-check-in teachers at their future timeslots if you like.

Teacher Interviews
------------------

*   Creating slots

*   Setting up teacher interviews or training sessions is very simple but also very tedious. This module makes it so teachers can sign up for interviews as part of their registration.
*   First, you want to go to the appropriate program under the black “Manage” tab and look for the link, “Teacher Training and Interviews.”
*   The start time is exactly as it sounds. It uses military time (24-hour format) and unfortunately automatically sets to today’s date.
*   Hours and minutes indicate how many hours and how many minutes in duration the meeting will be, NOT the hour and minute of the time of the meeting. If you are setting up 30-minute meetings, you will input 0 for hours and 30 for minutes into many timeslot entries.
*   Lastly, there are two options: training and interview. Training is an event that multiple teachers can sign up for. Interview is an event where only one teacher can sign up, and then the event is removed from the options available for other teachers.
*   You have to create a new slot from the beginning for every slot you want. There is no way to do “15-minute meetings between 3pm and 8pm” in one easy go.

*   Accessing schedule and changing things up

*   You can access the schedule by clicking the same link, “Teacher Training and Interviews” and scrolling down.
*   The real tricky thing is when you need to modify the schedule for a teacher. Let’s say a teacher signed up for an interview but for whatever reason you don’t want them there. Hitting the delete button next to their sign-up actually deletes the slot, which means you will need to recreate the slot if you want that time to be available for future teachers.

*   A better method is to morph into that user and remove their registration by going into their teacher registration and changing their sign-up.
*   OR you can go into /admin/ and select “User Availabilities”, then search for that user and delete the selection for that timeslot, and that will unregister.
*   Both of these methods remove the registration without deleting the actual timeslot, saving you the hassle of recreating the interview. This is especially important for when you are doing teacher trainings where deleting the timeslot could remove registration from many other teachers.

Volunteers Button on dashboard (as well as the Volunteers branch of the website)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forgot your username or password?
---------------------------------

*   The password recovery process for the website is pretty simple. One need only enter one’s username or email address into the Password Recovery page (available at /myesp/passwdrecover) and use the link that is emailed (using the email listed on the account, if one enters a username) to set a new password.
*    This link is hardcode on the “Login Help” page (available at /myesp/loginhelp.html or the need help? link in the upper right-hand corner of every page) as well as a few other places, but it is not very big, and it can always be more visible.

*   For that reason, you may want to paste hyperlinks to this page visibly around the website. In our experience many users (especially students and their guardians or teachers) will simply create a new account rather than try to get their password. We discourage this habit because it leads to confusion (which account is actually theirs), misrepresented statistics, unnecessarily saved seats (registrations), and wasted server space.
*   It is not uncommon for the recovery email to land in spam; make sure users check their spam folder when using this tool!

*   Note: you will only see this “need help?” link if you’re not already logged in! Use a different browser or a private browsing window if you want to compare what you see while you’re logged in to what the anonymous user sees.
*   Always use the password recovery page instead of changing a user’s password and emailing it to them. It is much safer.

Printing an Individual Student’s Schedule
-----------------------------------------

*   This section describes how to print a single student’s schedule (which you might want to do if it gets lost, for instance, or if the student wants to change classes after the schedules have been printed). To print multiple students’ schedules, see here.
*   Ways this can be done:

*   user search (print schedule option in the right-hand panel)
*   The student’s schedule as they would see it (morphing into student)
*   filtering schedules from printables
*   from onsite class changes grid (link to the existing instructions, though they don’t always work?) -- this is the fastest and best way to print a new schedule after changes on the day of the program

Intermediate level
==================

Things that are important, but will come about later on in your admin career

Deadlines II: Subdeadlines
--------------------------

Topics:

*   How to check, open/close, and create new subdeadlines (and knowing that they’ll override main deadlines)

*   Collapsing subdeadlines back into their parent deadlines (more advance but perhaps still belongs here?)
*   When access is deadline-based and when access is account-type-based

Creating a new program
----------------------

All changes can be undone nowadays via /admin/); see GitHub [developer notes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/de3f61f5da69ed098d64f23de3d40714fc0076b2/docs/dev/program_modules.rst&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115938457&usg=AOvVaw0y97QwWLqC1aga6-rLTSYo) and [admin notes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/e601c821223fb86189653aa766d9b6c85ba8df4a/docs/admin/program_modules.rst&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115938612&usg=AOvVaw10Fc4l5fyEX-Be8c-Luxmj) and Miles’ [waxing poetic](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/issues/608&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115938729&usg=AOvVaw1GfploKI4j4tvhRolyAzsE) / Miriam’s plans for more. Also, there is some [useful info on the wiki about this process](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://wiki.learningu.org/New_Program_Settings&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115938962&usg=AOvVaw1LQL72TDwmgHCMLoX0vcfL).

### Selecting Modules

A few notes: this section in its current form is intended for a general audience. Admins who know what they’re doing and why can add some of the “no” modules. The “alternate reg” modules form two or three separate registration profiles (lottery registration, two-phase lottery, and approval-required registration). If for some reason you are interested in using one of these registration setups, email websupport (you may need to remove or more more “yes” modules). If you include an optional module, it will be visible to teachers and/or students. Read more about those modules and their purposes [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/main/docs/admin/program_modules.rst&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115939892&usg=AOvVaw2hLWxt-EJN-_KcF86PsYy3).

Scheduling Classes
------------------

*   How to get to manual scheduling and AJAX scheduling (and why not to use manual)

*   Question: We are working on the website and are having issues with schedules. Usually there was a grid we could drop classes into, the grid is missing...
*   Solution: Have you added rooms and time blocks yet? The grid is made of rooms crossed with blocks, which can be added from the "Resources" button on the main portal. Let me know if you can't find it. I can walk you through it this evening.

*   Basics of how the AJAX scheduler works -- this should be updated after Ruthie’s huge overhaul
*   Advanced features
*   Scheduling tips and link to diagnostics \[link here to that section\]for proofreading (plus the importance of doing so)
*   Cornell recommends:

*   Try to keep in mind general rhythm of the day too (apprehension first period, grogginess late and right after lunch). Think about the content, interactivity, and size of the class. It also helps to imagine being several "archetypical" students and seeing if there would be any major conflicts for them or if they could mostly take classes they are interested in.

*   Clark recommends:

*   1\. Start with all classes that must be in a specific room (e.g. labs, dancing spaces, etc.)
*   2\. Filter all the highest-capacity classes and distribute them evenly throughout the time slots
*   3\. Try to accommodate teachers with multiple classes/sections (e.g. not running around campus / not too many or too few free blocks)
*   4\. Fill in the rest! I like going from largest to smallest class capacity to make sure I don't run out of larger rooms.
*   5\. Scheduling diagnostics (or strategies Miles mentioned):
*   Relatively even number of courses and student capacity (total and per grade) at each time slot

*   Ben Kraft (LU/MIT) recommends:  
    MIT Splash is usually quite tightly scheduled. I think the main thing we do is just spend a while iterating on the schedule, tighttening it up and checking everything over. Definitely start with the hardest classes to schedule as [Corey](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/coreybernstein?hc_location%3Dufi&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115973471&usg=AOvVaw1dHvmosbMOGYrliuM3clC9) said. We usually end up with nearly all classroom-hours in normal rooms filled -- if not, we just keep adjusting until we do, or until we've scheduled everything. At the end it's a bit of whackamole but it's hopefully decreasingly so as the final classes get scheduled.  
            Scheduling diagnostics is definitely useful in the "checking" phase -- if you just look over the checks a lot of them say roughly what they do, and if you have any specific questions I'm more than happy to help. Many of them grew out of things that MIT ESP checks for while scheduling -- making sure we minimize teachers running from one place to another, teachers teaching both blocks of lunch, and so on -- so on the one hand they're based on real problems, but on the other hand they may not all be problems that everyone has.
*   Ben Horowitz (Yale/LU) says:  
            Not to further add to the already over-contrained problem, but you might want to look at it in terms of class categories (science, art, etc.). Like when I was a Splash student I just signed up for all the hardest sounding math/physics classes possible... at a smaller Splash there might be few enough of a given genre that you need to think about how to place them throughout the day so the math nerds can take all hard math classes.  
            There might also be an argument made that you want to discourage people to only take one given class-type and to instead explore other topics (i.e. having one block be math heavy, one be art heavy, etc.) That is a bigger philosophical conversation though

Permissions
-----------

*   Overview & what they’re for (generally)
*   How to get there

To access Permissions, first go to \*.learningu.org/admin/. Under “Users,” select “Permissions” (alternatively, you can hit Ctrl or Cmd + F and search for permissions). Click “+ Add” in order to add a new permission. The “Start date” field will automatically populate with the current date and time. Note that when adding Permissions, as with most element of the LearningU site, dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format and time is in 24-hour, “military” format.You can change the Start date field’s date and time is you want the individual to be granted the permission sometime in the future--otherwise, the permission will be effective immediately after you save it. Then, use the “End date” field to select the date and time in the future you would like the permission to end. Apply the permission to a specific user using the “User” field. You can search for a user by their username, name, or ID number. Select the individual’s appropriate role from the “Role” dropdown.

*   By now, you should have a general idea of how these interfaces work (link to “Intro to /admin panel” part of Finaid if you want to review). This one is more about adding, expiring, and deleting. \[I feel like this needs elaboration, but it might be superfluous since those words are used in a non-technical sense here. Furthermore, the permissions are pretty self-explanatory, but we should mention any that we think need further clarification.\]
*   A few interesting/non-obvious/tricky/whatever examples and uses, since this section is starting to look a little skimpy for such an important module
*   See (Auth) groups for details on how to grant permissions to specific groups.
*   Note: these take precedence over all deadlines \[is that really true for all deadlines?\]

Records
-------

*   Very similar to permissions ya? Ya, but they get put in after something’s been done, rather than granting access for someone to do something in the future.

Line item types
---------------

*   For every program, you can add line items by going to /admin/accounting/lineitemtype and creating a new option. You can set the title, cost, program, and any relevant options for people to select from (such as shirt sizes or lunch orders).
*   Note that while you can supposedly set different costs to different options within one line item, this feature is BROKEN. Do not do this. If you need to do something like this, you will have to make separate line items.
*   Also note that making an item required if it has multiple options is problematic (I forget exactly what happens, but there’s something funny about it so be sure to test thoroughly).

Transfers (Accounting)
----------------------

### How to access Transfers

To access Transfers, go to \*.learningu.org/admin. Under “Accounting,” find “Transfers” (alternatively, you can search for Transfers using Ctrl or Cmd + F). Click “+ Add” to create a new transfer.

For receivables from a student (e.g. a student already paid but would like to add a t-shirt or lunch)

*   What receivable vs none vs a program name mean
*   “How to read transfers” \[we should establish a sign system like bolding or adding a \*\*\* to the “meat” of a given section, the rest being things that are important, but that an experienced admin might know; perhaps ### could me troubleshooting… I’m liking this idea\]

*   A transfer is roughly an IOU from one section of the website to another (accompanied by the reason).
*   A transfer from “receivable” to any program-name-looking account indicates that something has been reserved (lunch, admission, whatever) for that program (i.e. some of the money that we can receive/get out of the account has been designated as owed to that program).
*   A transfer indicates that a payment has occurred if it’s from None to receivable. That is, some non-internal source has sent money into the account where we can now receive it.
*   Do not confuse a receivable-to-program transfer as meaning someone has paid!

Modifying program parameters
----------------------------

For instance, adding and removing modules to a program) through /admin/program -- this may change (see above); this action is actually simple enough that we should probably include some “why you’d want to do this” explanation including/or some documentation of what the less-well-named modules do

Template Overrides
------------------

*   what they are
*   what pages -- and emails, etc. -- can (and can’t: things that aren’t in the [templates folder](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/tree/main/esp/templates&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115980212&usg=AOvVaw1e_XEgVcwHu2kiWx7Yo-h0)) be overridden from this interface
*   how to override website pages
*   Here's the basic process for working Template Overrides.

*   1\. Go to "Template Overrides" towards the bottom of /admin/.
*   2\. Either click on the one you want to modify or click "add new Template Override" if this is your first time modifying the page you want to change.
*   3\. If you added a new one, go to [github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115980802&usg=AOvVaw0i5-tiwBJNF-PhBjWm8L3g) and navigate to the template for the page you want to modify. (Note: not all pages of the site are drawn from templates, and therefore it is not possible to modify every page via Template Overrides!) If you don't know where to find it, you can either go to esp/templates and guess, or you can search for some distinctive text on the current version of the page.
*   4\. Once you've found the correct template (verify that it's the right page, for instance by checking that the text on the page matches the text on the template somewhere), note the path to it (it will start with esp/templates/).
*   5\. Make the change(es) you want and hit save!

*   modifying student schedules
*   modifying teacher schedules
*   Be careful! Messing with the wrong override can make your site appear to crash.

What all is there under “All Printables”?
-----------------------------------------

*   All printables can be accessed at /../../printoptions. A printable is anything that you might want to print off the website and is used to refer to any of the following items, individually or collectively.
*   Schedules

*   As with most things on the website, the selection tool is the same as that for [AULs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.eeygfp3hgpqf), so schedules may be printed for any list of users in any order that can be selected for an AUL. Don’t try to mix users and print all (student and teacher) schedules at once.
*   Student schedules are available in various formats

*   PDF works best for printing multiple schedules; TeX works best if you are familiar with it and want to make some “hands-on” changes before printing.

*   Teacher Schedules

*   Formatting: since the teacher schedules are drawn from a template in HTML, they look squished together, but if the template is not messed up, they generally looking good upon printing. See here for tips on making nice HTML and here for how to use template overrides.

*   Room Schedules \[self explanatory?\] Also can be overridden by template overrides.

*   Student Lists, sorted by various criteria
*   Receipts

*   a certification of completion for students, if you choose to offer this (many programs don’t)
*   lists of items that students purchased (see line item types)

*   Admin Binder Stuff

*   Most of these items are self-explanatory. They are lists of students, teachers, and classes sorted by various criteria that are useful to have on the day of the program.
*   Admin Binders are useful for looking up information on the day of the program, so long as the information is not actively being updated (in this case, it’s better to use the site itself to see the most recent information) or in case of the website crashing or emergencies. We recommend having at least one copy of emergency contact information and list of students who have checked in available in case of an emergency.

*   Other Printables

*   Course Catalog

*   available to be restricted and/or ordered by grade, category, title, start time, teacher name, and ID (order in which it was created on the website).
*   It can be useful to filter and reorder classes before presenting them to students if you want to enforce prerequisites or grade levels to respect the teachers.
*   There is also a tool (in the rightmost column) to manually reorder classes in the catalog before printing.

*   Meal tickets (by students): deprecated? It is often easier to print
*   On-Site Reg Form

*   This form is to register a student onsite (on paper) that an admin can enter into the website later for good record-keeping.

*   All Classes Spreadsheet

*   Master spreadsheet of all classes, generally for admin use only; use the course catalog for showing participants (students or teachers)

*   Viable Times for Sections Spreadsheet (CSV format; 'X' indicates a viable time)

*   All classes with an X to indicate when the teachers are available to teach this class. It can be useful for urgent rescheduling, but is not often used in my experience.

*   Guide for happy printables

*   This list was written for MIT ESP and is rather old. Firefox still works well, though Chrome does too. Other browsers may work. Georgia refers to the font \[I believe\]. Page-> options refers to the menu in the browser before printing (margins, headers, and footers can offset the printables and make the text spill over onto other pages)  
    In windows, print to Acrobat Distiller \[I don’t know that this is necessary\]. \*nix refers to Linux or Unix (the operating systems). Much of this may be out of date. I should check with benjkraft.

Student Class Reg Module Info
-----------------------------

*   This section is available at /admin/modules/studentclassregmoduleinfo/ and can be found under the “Modules” section of the admin panel.
*   Each program comes with its own (and only one) SCR module info page.

*   These can be located with a CTRL/CMD+F search, or the “filter” drop-down on the right.
*   It is not recommended to add new ones or delete existing ones, unless you really know what you are doing. (Thus the checkboxes on the left are rather useless.)

*   What is this for? Each info page contains several parameters for the /learn/../../studentreg process for the given program.

*   First, the “History” button in the upper right works as for most /admin/ pages. It can be useful for undoing changes, or seeing who’s made changes.
*   Many of the boxes come with good explanatory notes underneath. \[But questions are welcome here in the comments.\] Here are the ones we feel need further explanation:

*   Signup verb
*   Use Priority

*   This is where you can change several of the things that the student sees throughout the registration process (confirm button text, etc.)
*   IDK Dandan left and I’m tired and incoherent. Unclear to my scattered brain how much of this needs explaining, or whether just link to it. I’m slipping back into function-based explanation mode.

Class Reg Module info (without the “Student” in front):
-------------------------------------------------------

One use is to to modify the number of sections teachers can choose from. For a given program, just visit /admin/modules/classregmoduleinfo/ and set "Allowed Sections" to be the list of available section numbers you want (no spaces, just commas). Use the [tag](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tyEQ3cxJ4UCjm7EHgxFZx1j2Tl6TS7dZlCEMY34g9M/mobilebasic#h.be2xh7hvp1zf) min\_available\_timeslots set to your minimum in order to make the reg process easier on teachers.

Registration Confirmation
-------------------------

Write, edit, and enable sending of an automatic confirmation email to students (create/edit dbmail and enable student class reg module infos) -- a nice walkthrough of this already exists in PDF from: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ed7K7\_G58VOk24bV4OWg0\_xNgJ3CUX1S](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1Ed7K7_G58VOk24bV4OWg0_xNgJ3CUX1S&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115988977&usg=AOvVaw0Vsb2ThOtCQH8TdRF7cyXp)

Advanced level
==============

Complicated, sometimes extraneous but nice, might only need as program director
===============================================================================

Customforms
===========

*   viewing and downloading responses into spreadsheet
*   creating a new custom form

*   Creation process is actually pretty intuitive at first blush; we should review it for pieces that aren’t intuitive.
*   Tip: these are super buggy in their current form. We recommend against trying to edit or using old ones as a template; if you can, either create in one shot without too much editing or work out the kinks of how you want it to look in one form, then delete that form and create a second one all in one go. That said, sometimes it works.

*   A tidbit from Miriam:  
    There is actually a way to edit some of the help text in teacherreg! It's not at all obvious, but it exists. To edit the Planned Materials Purchases help text, you would create a new Tag (https://splashsc.learningu.org/admin/tagdict/tag/add/) with "teacherreg\_help\_text\_purchase\_requests" as the key, the text you want as the value, "program" for the content type, and your program's ID for the object ID. To change a different field, substitute "duration", "class\_size\_max", "num\_sections", "requested\_room", "message\_for\_directors", or "class\_info" (for the class description) for "purchase\_requests" in the key.

Tags
----

“Stolen” from a section Miles wrote for the January 2017 LU Newsletter.

What they’re good for: tags a strange beast. They come in many forms and are surprisingly versatile. On the most basic level, they associate one object (such as a questionnaire for students or teachers) with another (such as a specific Splash program for Spring 2017). For more common uses and how to set them up, read on!

How to get to the Tags page: navigate to the admin panel (yoursite.learningu.org/admin/), scroll down just above the bottom of the page, and click “Tags” under the heading “Tagdict” right above the “Users” heading. There may already be some tags there, but you’re probably more interested in creating a new one.

Common roles tags play are setting up questionnaires for a program, removing the “Plain” vs. “Fitted” distinction for shirts, and requiring teachers to mark themselves as available for more than one timeslot. (See, I told you they were versatile!) Dozens of further uses are available on the Tags page of the LU Wiki <[http://wiki.learningu.org/Customize\_behavior\_with\_Tags](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://wiki.learningu.org/Customize_behavior_with_Tags&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115992831&usg=AOvVaw2lNrC4Gbk-qbENX2P4X_nf)\>. Truthfully, this page is one of the best pages on the LU Wiki <wiki.learningu.org>. I’ll take this opportunity to suggest you sign up for an account if you don’t already have one, just so you can see how useful tags can be!

Example walkthrough: how to make a logistics quiz for teachers.

Step 1: create the quiz using custom forms. (You can find these forms at yoursite.learningu.org/customforms/, but they can be difficult to edit, so I recommend trying to make it all in one go.)

Step 2: Save your form’s number (the last number in the URL when you’re editing the form) for later.

Step 3: Find your program’s number. Navigate to yoursite.learningu.org/admin/program/program/ and hover the cursor over the program you want to add this form to; the final number in the URL that appears at the bottom of the screen is the number you want. (Note: you should make sure that “Teacher Logistics Quiz” module is added to the given program. If it’s not, you can navigate to the page where you can add it simply by clicking on the program.)

Step 4: Create the tag. Go back to the Tags page, and click the “Add tag” button towards the upper right of the page. The Key should be quiz\_form\_id, the Value should be the form number, the Content type should be program, and the Object id should be the program number. Click “Save” in the bottom right, and test it out! Your tag should be ready to go!

Scheduling Diagnostics
----------------------

*   Scheduling diagnostics is just a page that looks for potential problems with the schedule (such as too many admins teaching at a time, or teachers who don't have time for lunch). I also recommend looking at dashboard statistics to see whether there's a good balance of categories and open seats for each time slot and also looking at the onsite class changes grid to see if there's a good balance of classes available to each grade. I also have (somewhere) a different list of diagnostics to check by hand... I will dig it up eventually.

These will not work to redirect the homepage of your site to another page. There are usually ways around that, but there are also usually better ways to accomplish your goal, too (if, for instance, you don’t like the QSD front of your Angry Fruitsalad theme).

Themes
------

From Ben Kraft: If you find the theme isn't really what you want, you can change it -- see [instructions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/main/docs/admin/themes.rst&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115995919&usg=AOvVaw0ZhGxD_1Uz8w-wRURmvixZ) and the [list of available themes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/main/docs/admin/available_themes.rst&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115996045&usg=AOvVaw0oBYkJMB2oV5mPnkBDbZTT).

Another useful thread from Hari, Ben Kraft, Miriam, and Miles:

How to change the front-end of our website? One of our admins created a new design, which includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, and we're not entirely sure how to change the website so it looks like that.

This is pretty complicated to do -- the files will need to get integrated into the templates of the website via template overrides, and the CSS and JS will need to get uploaded to the site as well.  If at all possible, the ideal thing is actually to make a new theme based on your templates, because that's easier for us to maintain and also allows other chapters to benefit from it.  But in any case, if you can start by sending us the files you have, so we can figure out what you have so far and what you or we will still need to do, that would be great.

Sounds great. I've attached what we have as a zipped folder. Let me know what the next steps should be!

There are two routes we can take to integrate this into the website.  The first is to use template overrides.  This is somewhat easier, but also somewhat more likely to cause issues down the road.  The second is to convert it into a new theme option.  This is somewhat harder, but has the major advantage that it will also be available for other programs to use.

I've put some more details of what needs to happen for either approach below; obviously I'm happy to give more details as is helpful (probably a video call will be the best way).  If you take the second option, I and perhaps others from the web team are happy to help out with some or all of the work; obviously this has the advantage that it's less or perhaps no work for you and the disadvantage that whatever I'm doing will happen when I have time -- if there's a particular time you want it done by I can try for that but no guarantees.  I'm of course happy to continue to answer questions for either approach.

To convert it to a template override:

1\. Templatize your index.html and your inner.html (our main.html).  They will be replacing index.html and main.html in our templates [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/tree/main/esp/templates&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115998230&usg=AOvVaw3oMLgZEFKUitQY00TjS-HN).  The versions your current theme uses are [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/tree/main/esp/esp/themes/theme_data/fruitsalad/templates&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115998368&usg=AOvVaw1CJYVFTVOwsJip3zsrW0J8).  This mainly just involves separating the parts of the template out so it will get included into our wrapper and then include the text for other pages.  It's not too hard, but it will require getting a bit familiar with Django templating and our templates if you're not already.

2\. Clean up the CSS to make sure it will play nice with ours.  This is a bit tricky because the site template you used has a lot of CSS, much of which is probably unnecessary.  Basically the way to do this is to do #1, then do #3 on a dev server (we can set up one of the [dev.learningu.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dev.learningu.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281115998962&usg=AOvVaw0DnH60W_l3gl9LaNGXGAJs) sites for this) and fiddle with the CSS until it works.

3\. Upload everything to the site.  The two templates from #1 will become template overrides in the admin panel, and the CSS, JS, and images will go in the media folders through the admin panel's file browser.

To convert it to a theme:

0\. Agree to have your theme integrated as an option for other chapters.  (This need not include the pictures, since other chapters would provide their own.)

1\. Templatize the files. as above.  In addition, it'll need to have anything Yale-specific modified to use template variables as the builtin templates do, and anything customizable will need to be modified per #3 below.

2\. Clean up the CSS, as above.  The standard is a little higher here because we'll be maintaining the CSS going forward, and I don't really want to import hundreds of lines we don't need, so this will be a bit of work to decide what we want to do, and eliminate and simplify whatever's unused, which I expect is most of it.  Perhaps we can find a tool that will do much of it automatically, or end up deciding to keep much of it.  Also, anything customizable will need to be modified per #3 below.

3\. Make any code changes needed to support whatever customizable navbars and such the theme will have.

4\. Test everything on a dev site.  (Again, we can set up one of the [dev.learningu.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dev.learningu.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281116000389&usg=AOvVaw0ALyUCuDVNore09C9Ascgj) sites.)

5\. Make a pull request to our codebase and get it reviewed by someone else from the web team.

6\. (Can actually be in parallel with 4/5) migrate your site to use the new theme.

My preference is obviously to do the latter option, but I realize you may not wait for me to do this on whatever timescale I have time, especially since I'm fairly busy over the next month or so, so if you want to do the first option, that works too.

Question about that conversion process: we're not entirely sure what changes should be made for the CSS?

It looks like bootstrap, which we already use, includes normalize.css, so that shouldn't be an issue, which is nice.  So there's not too much of a giant blob that's unnecessary.  I'd like to look through some of the other stuff in main.css that came from the framework you used to see if we actually need it, but that's actually only a couple hundred lines so it shouldn't be too bad.  We'll probably want to make the tab colors customizable, but that's easy enough to do.

So in short, the CSS cleanup will hopefully be a lot easier than I expected.  We'll probably need to clean a few things up if they cause issues after it's all integrated into the site, but we can cross that bridge when we come to it.

 I wanted to ask a specific question about how I could go about making it into a theme. Earlier in the conversation you stated that the first step was to templatize index.html and inner.html (which will become main.html). Can you clarify a bit more about what this step means? More specifically, what format should I be following, where in the repo should I be adding these files and specifically what files should I be adding? I'd love to get started on this process in the hopes that it could be done by the start of the semester?

The templates and css for existing themes are in [https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/tree/main/esp/esp/themes/theme\_data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/tree/main/esp/esp/themes/theme_data&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281116002475&usg=AOvVaw1mAqsY4TmXGAPf80Jk87eY).  So basically, you want to convert inner.html to a main.html file like those, for a new theme, so that it will have similar template tags to make sure the site content gets included in the right places.  If you want to make a pull request to that repo that would be ideal.

If it would be helpful, I'm happy to hop on a call sometime to talk about this further and help you get started, although my time this week is somewhat limited and I'm away the following week.  Again, sorry for the delay in moving on this.

Just a quick question, is there any sort of dev environment I can test this on to see how it looks before making the pull request?

I've been trying to setup a local environment where I can test the changes I've been making to the HTML/CSS files, and I'm getting an error. I followed the steps found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/main/docs/dev/vagrant.rst&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281116003454&usg=AOvVaw0-JwDstSGQrQx_mgchUtdh), with the only change being I cloned my fork of the ESP-Website rather than the master repo. After running fab runserver and navigating to localhost:8000 I get the error:

Error at /

error 26 from memcached\_mget: Operation now in progress

This is a known issue with the dev servers. When it happens, it means that you have

to restart memcached.

1\. In the [main.html file](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/main/esp/esp/themes/theme_data/fruitsalad/templates/main.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281116004347&usg=AOvVaw1MjpJXs5WLYaFAq15qUtMf), how is the stylesheet being loaded in? I see the block stylesheet part of it, but it seems like everything in that block is commented out?

The stylesheet comes from [elements/html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/blob/main/esp/templates/elements/html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281116004632&usg=AOvVaw18sAbrV8-Ajoc8J398T0Of), which the theme probably shouldn't need to modify.  Then we use [django template inheritance](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/templates/%23template-inheritance&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1766281116004795&usg=AOvVaw1VNhrM_oqpbHFbKsivWUAm) to modify that for main.html (and then from there for individual templates.)

Causes of server errors:
========================

NEU class registration and teacherreg pages not displaying correctly

        Errors: NoReverseMatch; DoesNotExist with value ClassSubject matching query does not exist.

Changing the program name at all after it's created makes me nervous, but it's probably fine in this case? It definitely wasn't the original cause of the problem. The original cause of the problem was their classreg email template override, which as far as I can tell existed for no reason; I deleted it. I have no idea what could be causing your second error, and I can't reproduce it.

The problem was with your template override for the class registration email, in a way that only affected the version sent to admins. As far as I can tell, it was just an older version of the default, so I deleted it, and registration appears to work now. Let us know if you see any more issues.

I think there's also some weird stuff going on with Northeastern's theme--the profile page is \*really\* ugly. (I fixed the ugly--they still have a ton of unnecessary template overrides from when their site was first set up and they were on Chicago's new theme, which was probably done by copying over all of Chicago's template overrides, many of which don't make sense on fruitsalad or without Chicago's other site customizations)

Plans to document the website are progressing very slowly, but progressing nonetheless. As discussed, one next step include creating a top-down organizational hierarchy based on difficulty, usefulness, and frequency of the various actions to be performed. The other is to build individual "modules" of info-graphic-style slides describing how to do individual actions. I'll continue to work on these slowly throughout the year and recruit help as possible. I'll also plan to run a work-session on this at SplashCon.
