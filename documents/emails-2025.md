|  Hello\!  Sprout at Yale is a twice-year opportunity for 6th-9th grade students to attend classes taught by Yale students in Yale classrooms\! We are excited to inform you that student registration for Sprout at Yale is now open, and will close at 11:59PM on Wednesday, November 12th. Registration is on a first come first serve basis and classes fill quickly, so please register as soon as possible. We hope to welcome you back to this fantastic event.  Sprout offers a dynamic two-day program featuring classes taught by Yale students covering various subjects. From *A Middle Schooler's Guide to Calculus,* to *Ancient Cookbooks and Recipes,* and *Global Health 101*, our classes will cater to students from 6th to 9th grade this semester. You can find more information, including our [registration portal](https://yale.learningu.org/learn/sprout.html), on our website.   Unlike Splash at Yale, Sprout offers core classes, subjects that are taught over both days, where content from the first carries on to the next—allowing students to delve deeper into their interests\! On top of this, Sprout will still involve the fun elective-style classes that you know and love from Splash.  This spring, Sprout will take place on November 15th and 16th, from 10 AM to 3:10 PM, in Linsly-Chittenden Hall (63 High St, New Haven, CT 06511\) on Yale’s campus. We cordially invite you to join us for an enriching experience\! Sprout costs $40 for the two days, with an option to purchase a $10 T-shirt. Financial aid is available to all students who require it.   Once again, you students can register at [https://yale.learningu.org/learn/sprout.html](https://yale.learningu.org/learn/sprout.html). We eagerly anticipate welcoming you back to Yale’s campus this fall\!

|  Dear {{user.first\_name}},  Thank you to everyone who made Splash such a success this year\! This year, nearly 500 students came to take a class designed by members of the Yale student body. If you are eager to teach again, or couldn’t make this past Splash program, you don’t have to wait long\! Teacher registration for Sprout Spring ‘25 has opened and you can register your class (core or elective) at our website by following this [link](https://yale.learningu.org/teach/Sprout/2025_Fall/teacherreg).   For those who need a refresher, Sprout Spring ‘25 is a 2-day program, running on the Saturday and Sunday of November 15th and November 16th. This semester, Sprout will be for 6th to 9th-grade students, where students from around the tri-state area will sign up to learn from you all, the undergraduate teachers. You can teach any topic, from “Bioethics and Law” to “Kombucha 101”.  At Sprout, you may teach a core class or an elective class. Core classes meet on both November 15th and November 16th, allowing for a more immersive experience as students will better understand the class topics. Core class teachers must commit to teaching on both days. Please ensure you are available at your scheduled teaching time, as last-minute cancellations will leave students with a hole in their schedule\!   Elective classes meet only once on either Sprout days, which is ideal for teachers who are only available on one of the days. Similarly, committing to teaching at your scheduled time is extremely important for the students’ experiences at Sprout.  Again, here is the link at which you can register your classes, open from now until October 22nd: [https://yale.learningu.org/teach/Sprout/2025\_Fall/teacherreg](https://yale.learningu.org/teach/Sprout/2025_Fall/teacherreg)    Please email us with any questions you have.

|  Dear students, parents, and educators,  We look forward to seeing you in New Haven soon\! With two days to go before our Splash at Yale Fall 2025 program on Saturday (October 4th), we wanted to send along some important information to ensure that the day proceeds as smoothly as possible.   Drop-off Location Please drop-off at [Phelps Gate](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Phelps+Gate/@41.3084798,-72.9287193,18.56z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e7d9b49b5f6e35:0x430d02a44c7ce255!8m2!3d41.3084253!4d-72.9281299!16s%2Fg%2F1hhv_9qw3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIxOS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (344 College St, New Haven, CT 06511). Volunteers will be present to guide students and parents from there.   Location The program will be held in Linsly-Chittenden Hall (“LC” — 63 High Street), and William L. Harkness Hall (“WLH” — 100 Wall Street). The Splash Administration Team will have a headquarters in LC 104.  Check-in Check-in will be held on the first floor of Linsly-Chittenden Hall, beginning at 8:45 AM. Please enter through Phelps Gate and walk to Linsly-Chittenden Hall, which will be marked with signs. For check-ins after 10:00 AM, please go to our headquarters location to sign in and receive student schedules. Late payment, t-shirt purchases, and class adjustments will also be available during check-in.  Schedules Students will be handed their schedules during check-in on the day of Splash. The schedule will have all the information needed for the day including classes, timeslots, and locations.   Class changes The Student Portal for class changes is now closed. If a student wishes to change classes, please come to Admin HQ at LC 104, and we will arrange a schedule change.   Pickup We recommend students meet parents outside of Phelps Gate to be picked up, however, we allow students to make separate arrangements with their parents if it’s more convenient.  Policy on students’ interest in classes *Splash depends on student enthusiasm*. We really cannot emphasize this policy enough. We are very serious about making the day fun, and therefore, we would like to request that you do not push your kids into taking any classes they don’t want to.  Troubleshooting If you have questions throughout the day, look for the admin team in navy blue shirts in our headquarters (Linsly-Chittenden Hall, room 104\) or email us at yalesplash@gmail.com. Our contact number on Saturday will be ‪(203) 868-0478‬  General Reminders Payment is now closed, but you may pay in-person during check in through cash or card for no additional cost.  You must be enrolled in a class during every time slot. Please email us or check in with us on the morning of the program to ensure you have a full schedule. Since we will be moving between two buildings, our administrative staff will be walking students between each building before and after each class. Please wait for a team member and do not walk by yourself between buildings\! Please email us with any dietary restrictions before the day of Splash so we can plan for lunch accommodations.   Questions? Concerns? Thoughts? Please look at [our webpage](http://yale.learningu.org/) (especially [FAQ](https://yale.learningu.org/faq.html)) for more details about Splash, and feel free to email us at yalesplash@gmail.com with anything that isn’t addressed there.
